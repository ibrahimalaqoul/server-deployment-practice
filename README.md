# server-deployment-practice
This repo for CI/CD , we will build a test and a server in it.

## my notes :
#### for today's Task I created A server and test to test this server and  depending on  the "CI/CD.
### **In steps** :
* Before I started the server and test work i did creat a repo and created the action to active the CI/CD  and adding the branch dev to it. 
* At the first I installed packages like "express,dotenv" and  created the server as we know we should creat the package json file using "npm init -y" and then we should  download express which is a framework to the node.js.
* Then i create the server as requiring the express and the dotenv..etc.

* Then after the sever is working we build the test as we know we should install some packages "jest,supertest" and i created the  folder "__test__" and we created the server.test.js file .

 * Then  i required the server.js in the test file.

 *  Then i wrote all my tests.

 * the last step i did deploy the dev and main branch to heroku wesite.
