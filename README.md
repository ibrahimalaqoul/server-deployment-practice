# server-deployment-practice
This repo for CI/CD , we will build a test and a server in it.

## my notes :
I did understand :

1-why we use promises ,callbacks,asynch/await.

2- TDD is driving the code to be tested depending on the test.

3- there are many packages to test such as "jset".

4- we can fake running the server using "super test" package.

5-we can test any thing in the limit of our code.

6- we can use describe to seperate the tests.

7-we use it method to write a test.

8- we creat a folder for test which should be named as "__tests__ (Links to an external site.)".

9- the test file should be filename.test.js.
